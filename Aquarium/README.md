### Tip

Uploading or changing a theme's folder to GitHub will make it appear on the website (at the bare minimum the site will display in alphabetical order themes listed in `themes.json` or not listed, provided it has a directory name, `config.json`, and a `*cover*.*` file available).

## Theme Information and URLs

### Where Theme Information is Stored

Theme information can be stored in two places, with different priorities:

#### 1. `config.json` (Same Directory - Highest Priority)

The `config.json` file in your theme's folder is the **most authoritative** source for theme information. It should contain a `theme_info` section:

```json
{
    "theme_info": {
        "title": "Aero",
        "author": "u/YourUsername",
        "authorUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/user/YourUsername",
        "description": "A description of your theme."
    },
    ...
}
```

**Priority:** Information in `config.json` takes precedence over `themes.json` when both are present.

**Important:** The `authorUrl` field can be used for **any link of the author's choice** - this could be:
- A link to the original source/announcement for the theme (e.g., Reddit post, forum thread)
- The author's portfolio or personal website
- The author's social media profile
- Any other relevant link the author wants to share

This URL will be automatically linked from all mentions of the author's name on the theme's `index.html` description page, making it easy for users to find more information about the theme or the author's other work.

#### 2. `themes.json` (Root Directory - Fallback)

The `themes.json` file in the repository root serves as a fast cache for the main page. It contains an array of theme objects:

```json
{
    "themes": [
        {
            "name": "Aero",
            "folder": "Aero",
            "screenshot": "./Aero/screenshot.jpg",
            "description": "This theme is inspired by Windows Vista.",
            "author": "u/Neither-Classic2058",
            "authorUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/innioasis/comments/..."
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Priority:** Used as a fallback if `config.json` doesn't contain theme information, or for initial page load performance.

**Note:** The `authorUrl` in `themes.json` works the same way as in `config.json` - it can point to any link the author chooses (original source, portfolio, social media, etc.) and will be linked from author mentions on the theme's description page.

### Theme URLs and Social Sharing

Each theme automatically receives a unique URL based on its folder name:

**Format:** `https://themes.innioasis.app/[ThemeFolderName]`

**Example:** If your theme folder is named `Aero`, the theme's URL will be:
- `https://themes.innioasis.app/Aero`

**⚠️ Important: `index.html` is Required for Theme URLs**

For a theme to be accessible via its URL and shareable, **you must include an `index.html` file** in your theme's folder. Without `index.html`, users will not be able to:
- Visit the theme's dedicated page
- Share the theme's URL on social media
- Link directly to the theme from other websites
- Bookmark the theme page

**How it works:**
- When you place an `index.html` file in your theme folder, GitHub Pages automatically serves it when someone visits `https://themes.innioasis.app/[YourThemeFolder]`
- The main themes page links to individual themes using the format `[ThemeFolder]/index.html`
- If `index.html` is missing, the link will result in a 404 error

**Getting started:**
- You can copy the `index.html` template from another theme's folder
- The `index.html` file will automatically load theme information from `config.json` and `themes.json` (as described above)
- You don't need to manually edit `index.html` - it will dynamically display your theme's information

This URL is useful for:
- **Social Sharing:** Share your theme directly on social media platforms
- **Direct Links:** Link to your theme from forums, Reddit, or other websites
- **Bookmarking:** Users can bookmark specific themes
- **SEO:** Search engines can index individual theme pages

The URL is automatically generated from the theme's folder name, so make sure your folder name is descriptive and URL-friendly (use letters, numbers, and hyphens, avoid spaces and special characters).
